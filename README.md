Portfolio of my data science projects

## Project 1: Analyzing the 2017 Houston Astros Cheating Scandal
* Did a basic exploratory analysis of the 2017 which confirms a stat boost coinciding with their cheating.
* Analyzed over 8000 pitches from home games to find which players used and benefited most from the sign stealing scheme.
* Built a model to predict the outcome the 2017 season.  
* Utilized a Mann-Whitney U test our hypothesis
